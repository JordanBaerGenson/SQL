#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--Question 1: How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT COUNT (distinct orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Question 2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (distinct orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

--Question 3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID;

--Question 4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct JanSales.price, JanSales.product 
FROM JanSales 
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM bit_db.JanSales)
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Question 5: What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Question 6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as TotalRevenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--Question 7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count (distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
